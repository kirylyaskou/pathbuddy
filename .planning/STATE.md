# STATE.md - Pathfinder 2e DM Assistant

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Feature-complete PF2e DM tool — accurate game logic engine powering a React frontend with real Foundry VTT data.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — vite-scaffold-nextjs-teardown

## Current Position

Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-31

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/6 phases complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions carrying forward from prior milestones:

- VALUED_CONDITIONS includes dying/wounded; dying/wounded cascade gates on has() before delete
- Group exclusivity: clear all group members except new slug, then set
- ImmunityType combines DAMAGE_TYPES + DAMAGE_CATEGORIES + special strings (critical-hits, precision)
- vitality/void used instead of positive/negative energy — PF2e Remaster taxonomy
- All previous milestones (v1.0–v2.1) squashed into single initial commit for fresh start
- @engine path alias configured in tsconfig.json (two entries: @engine -> index.ts, @engine/* -> engine/*)
- Single barrel export at engine/index.ts only — no per-subdirectory index.ts
- Keep React, skip Vue port — working prototype exists, porting is pure cost
- Next.js to Vite+React — SSR unnecessary for Tauri desktop SPA; createHashRouter mandatory (no server for HTML5 history)
- FSD architecture for frontend layers (app/pages/widgets/features/entities/shared)
- Zustand 5 + immer middleware for state management; useShallow mandatory for object selectors
- shadcn/ui (Radix) component library stays; re-init with rsc: false for Vite
- @vitejs/plugin-react (NOT swc — archived) for Vite React support
- getSqlite() raw SQL for performance-critical paths (batch insert, FTS5)
- Splash-before-router pattern for async DB initialization — migrations complete before React mounts
- import.meta.glob for Drizzle migrations (Node.js fs crashes in WebView)
- shared/api/ is sole Tauri IPC boundary — all invoke() calls centralized there
- Engine stays outside FSD as external lib consumed via @engine alias — not modified in v0.3.0
- ConditionManager: module-level Map pattern, NOT in React/Zustand state (mutation bypass)
- Entity state (serializable, SQLite-derived) separated from feature runtime state (session, in-memory)
- [Phase 05]: @vitejs/plugin-react downgraded from ^6.0.1 to ^5.2.0 (v6 requires Vite 8, project uses Vite 6)
- [Phase 05]: eslint downgraded from ^10.1.0 to ^9.22.0 (eslint-plugin-import only supports up to eslint 9)
- [Phase 05]: npm install ran without --legacy-peer-deps — no Radix peer dep conflicts with React 19.2.4

### Pending Todos

- Run `npm install` in Phase 5; add `--legacy-peer-deps` if Radix peer dep conflicts with React 19 surface
- Audit Foundry VTT sync migration SQL filenames for lexicographic sort order before Phase 7
- Verify exact `plugin:sql|execute` / `plugin:sql|select` IPC command name strings against tauri-plugin-sql v2.3.2 Rust source at start of Phase 7

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
