 (completed 2026-04-02)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Cleanup + Architecture
**Goal**: Codebase is engine-only — all UI deleted, PWOL removed, PF2e modules live in `/engine` with clean barrel exports and zero UI dependencies
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CLN-01, CLN-02, ARCH-01, ARCH-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. No Vue components, views, stores, composables, router files, or styles exist anywhere in the repo
  2. No PWOL references exist in any engine module or config file
  3. All PF2e modules (xp.ts, damage.ts, modifiers.ts, damage-helpers.ts, iwr.ts, conditions.ts) are under `/engine`
  4. `/engine/index.ts` barrel export exists and imports nothing from UI, Tauri, Pinia, or Vue
**Plans:** 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Delete all UI code, Tauri backend, non-engine files; strip PWOL from XP module
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Relocate engine to /engine with domain subdirectories; create barrel export; configure project

### Phase 2: Reference Analysis
**Goal**: The gap between the current engine and the Foundry VTT PF2e system is fully documented — every missing mechanic identified and prioritized
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: ANAL-01, ANAL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A gap-analysis document exists describing what the `refs/` repo implements vs. what `/engine` currently covers
  2. A prioritized list of missing mechanics (conditions, statuses, actions) exists with notes on which are essential for DM use
**Plans:** 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Analyze refs/pf2e/ across 12 PF2e domains; produce GAP-ANALYSIS.md with prioritized missing-mechanics list

### Phase 3: Conditions & Statuses
**Goal**: The engine implements the complete set of PF2e conditions and statuses identified as missing in Phase 2 analysis
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: ENG-01
**Note**: Scope is intentionally high-level — exact mechanics are determined by Phase 2 gap analysis
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All conditions and statuses flagged as missing in the gap-analysis document are implemented in `/engine`
  2. Each implemented condition matches Foundry VTT PF2e source behavior for its value range, cascade rules, and group exclusivity
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 4: Actions & Modifier Math
**Goal**: The engine implements missing actions from analysis and produces correct final modifier values for all bonus and penalty combinations
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: ENG-02, ENG-03
**Note**: Scope is intentionally high-level — exact actions are determined by Phase 2 gap analysis
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All actions flagged as missing in the gap-analysis document are implemented in `/engine`
  2. Typed bonuses stack by taking the highest bonus and lowest penalty per type (not summing all)
  3. Untyped bonuses stack additively
  4. A given set of modifiers produces the same final value as the Foundry VTT PF2e reference implementation for that modifier combination
**Plans:** 4 plans
Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Type foundations: expanded Creature interface, Action type system, degree-of-success module, performRecoveryCheck refactor
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Action data: ingest 545 entries from refs/, hand-code ~40 combat outcome descriptors
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Statistic system: Statistic class, selector resolver, CreatureStatistics adapter, condition auto-injection, MAP attack sets
- [x] 04-04-PLAN.md — Barrel export: wire all Phase 4 modules into engine/index.ts

### Phase 5: Vite Scaffold + Next.js Teardown
**Goal**: The project runs as a Tauri 2 + Vite 6 + React 19 SPA in dev mode — all Next.js artifacts eliminated, routing scaffolded with createHashRouter, and the full PF2e dark fantasy design system rendering correctly
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: FND-01, FND-02, FND-03, FND-04, FND-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `npm run tauri dev` starts the app without errors; all page routes render a placeholder without crashing
  2. Navigating between routes works via React Router v7 hash-based links — no `next/link`, `usePathname`, or `useRouter` imports survive anywhere in src/
  3. All PF2e OKLCH color tokens (`bg-pf-gold`, `text-pf-threat-extreme`, `bg-sidebar`, etc.) render correctly in the app — the dark fantasy UI is visually intact
  4. All 60+ shadcn/ui Radix components are importable and render without errors in Vite (rsc: false, no SSR)
  5. `steiger` FSD linter and `eslint-plugin-boundaries` run on `npm run lint` and enforce layer import direction with zero false negatives
**Plans:** 3/3 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Scaffold Tauri 2 + Vite 6 project infrastructure, install deps, create PF2e OKLCH design system
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Initialize shadcn/ui, copy 64 components, create hash router with 8 pages, port navigation shell
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Wire steiger + eslint-plugin-boundaries FSD linting, visual verification checkpoint
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 6: FSD Structure + Zustand Stores
**Goal**: The codebase is organized under FSD layers with all Zustand stores designed and stubbed — entity state (SQLite-derived, serializable) is separated from feature runtime state (session, in-memory), and the @engine alias and shared/api/ IPC boundary are live
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: ARCH-03, ARCH-04, ARCH-05, ARCH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All source files live under `app/`, `pages/`, `widgets/`, `features/`, `entities/`, or `shared/` — no files remain in legacy prototype directories
  2. Entity stores (`entities/creature/`, `entities/combatant/`, `entities/condition/`, `entities/encounter/`) hold only serializable SQLite-derived data; feature stores hold only session runtime state — no store mixes both
  3. Every `invoke()` call in the codebase is inside `shared/api/` — zero `invoke()` calls exist in features/, widgets/, or pages/
  4. `import('@engine/...')` resolves correctly in both `features/` and `entities/` layers via `vite-tsconfig-paths`; `eslint-plugin-boundaries` reports no violations
**Plans:** 4/4 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Install zustand + immer; create shared/api/ IPC boundary with stubbed creature/combat/db wrappers
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Create 4 full entity slices (creature, combatant, condition, encounter) with Zustand stores; move PF2e components to entity ui/ segments
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Create 3 minimal entity skeletons (spell, item, hazard) with type stubs and barrel exports
- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md — Create 3 feature slice stores (combat-tracker, bestiary-browser, encounter-builder); ARCH-04 human-verify checkpoint

### Phase 7: SQLite + Foundry VTT Data Pipeline
**Goal**: The app reads real Foundry VTT entity data from SQLite — migrations run before React mounts, the sync pipeline imports 28K+ entities, FTS5 full-text search works across all entity types, and the mock data file is gone
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04, DATA-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The splash screen completes DB migration before React Router mounts — no route renders before the schema is current
  2. Triggering Foundry VTT sync downloads the latest release ZIP and upserts 28K+ entities into SQLite without errors
  3. Typing a creature name in FTS5 search returns matching results in under 200ms with the full 28K+ entity dataset loaded
  4. `src/lib/pf2e-data.ts` (or equivalent mock data file) does not exist anywhere in the codebase — `git ls-files | grep pf2e-data` returns nothing
**Plans:** 5/5 plans created
Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Tauri SQL plugin + DB schema + migrations + entity type fixes (DATA-01)
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Rust sync command: download ZIP, extract JSON, return entities (DATA-02)
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Splash screen gate component with branded PF2e aesthetic (DATA-04)
- [x] 07-04-PLAN.md — Frontend sync pipeline + FTS5 search queries (DATA-02, DATA-03)
- [ ] 07-05-PLAN.md — Settings page sync UI + mock data cleanup (DATA-02, DATA-05)

### Phase 8: Combat Tracker + Engine Integration
**Goal**: The DM can run a full combat encounter — adding creatures from the bestiary, tracking initiative order, adjusting HP/tempHP, and managing conditions — with the engine ConditionManager handling all PF2e condition rules including auto-decrement at turn end
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: CMB-01, CMB-02, CMB-03, CMB-04, CMB-05, BEST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The DM can search the bestiary, click a creature, and see it appear in the combat tracker with correct initiative slot
  2. Clicking increment/decrement on a combatant's HP updates the value immediately; tempHP absorbs damage before HP and drains first
  3. The DM can add a condition to a combatant from a dropdown and see a badge appear with the correct icon and numeric value for valued conditions (Frightened 2, Sickened 1, etc.)
  4. Clicking "End Turn" for a combatant with Frightened or Sickened automatically decrements the condition value by 1 (or removes it at 0) via engine CONDITION_EFFECTS
  5. The active turn is highlighted; round and turn counters increment correctly when advancing through the initiative order
**Plans:** 4/4 plans created
Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Infrastructure: combat DB schema, @dnd-kit install, store refactors, ConditionManager bridge
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — 3-panel layout + initiative list (DnD) + bestiary search panel + creature/PC add
- [x] 08-03-PLAN.md — Combatant detail panel + HP controls + condition combobox + condition badges
- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md — Turn advancement + auto-decrement + previous turn + toasts + SQLite auto-save
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 9: Bestiary Browser + Encounter Builder
**Goal**: The DM can browse and search 28K+ real PF2e creatures with full stat blocks, and build encounters with a live XP budget bar that uses the engine's encounter rating calculation — not mock functions
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: BEST-01, BEST-02, ENC-01, ENC-02, ENC-03, ENC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The DM can type a name, select level range, creature type, rarity, and source filters — the bestiary list updates immediately with matching Foundry VTT entities
  2. Clicking a creature in the bestiary shows its full stat block: HP, AC, saves, IWR breakdown, strikes, and special abilities — all from real Foundry data, no hardcoded values
  3. Adding a creature to an encounter draft immediately updates the XP budget bar — the bar reflects engine `calculateEncounterRating` output, not a local mock calculation
  4. Changing party size or party level in the encounter config immediately recalculates XP budget and threat rating — the threat label (Trivial / Low / Moderate / Severe / Extreme) updates in real time from the engine
**Plans:** 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Bestiary browser with FTS5 filters, stat block mapper, filter bar, 2-panel page
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Encounter builder with party config persistence, engine XP budget, creature draft
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 10: P2 Differentiators
**Goal**: The engine's unique PF2e capabilities — IWR preview, Dying/Wounded cascade, Weak/Elite presets, persistent damage, MAP attack display, and hazard XP — are surfaced in the UI, giving DMs information no competing tool provides
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: INT-01, INT-02, INT-03, INT-04, INT-05, INT-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When the DM enters a damage value and type in the damage dialog, the UI displays the engine `applyIWR` breakdown (raw damage, immunity/resistance/weakness applied, final damage) before the DM confirms
  2. When a combatant reaches 0 HP, a Dying/Wounded cascade dialog appears; the DM can trigger a recovery check and see the engine `performRecoveryCheck` result (success/failure/critical) with the resulting condition change
  3. When adding a creature from the bestiary to combat, the DM can select Weak or Elite tier — HP adjusts immediately using engine `getHpAdjustment` before the creature enters the tracker
  4. Combatants with persistent damage show a prompt at turn end for a flat-check roll; passing removes the condition, failing deals the persistent damage
  5. The creature stat block displays MAP attack modifier sets (MAP 0 / MAP -5 / MAP -10) computed by engine `buildAttackModifierSets`; hazard entries in the encounter builder contribute XP via engine `getHazardXp`
**Plans:** 4/4 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Weak/Elite tier toggle on creature add + MAP attack display in stat block (INT-03, INT-05)
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — IWR damage preview with type combobox and engine applyIWR breakdown (INT-01)
- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md — Dying/Wounded cascade dialog + persistent damage flat-check toasts (INT-02, INT-04)
- [x] 10-04-PLAN.md — Hazard XP in encounter builder via engine getHazardXp (INT-06)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 11: App Shell Fixes
**Goal**: The app presents a polished first impression and the encounters page loads reliably — no white flash on startup, no crash from the Radix ScrollArea infinite re-render
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: SPLASH-01, FIX-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On app launch the user sees an animated CSS d20 die spinning with rotating D&D/PF2e flavor messages instead of a blank white screen
  2. Loading messages cycle through at least 5 thematic strings while the DB initializes
  3. Navigating to the Encounters page does not crash or freeze — the page renders and is fully interactive
  4. The Radix ScrollArea component on the Encounters page renders without triggering an infinite re-render loop (no React "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in console)
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Animated d20 splash screen with TTRPG loading messages (SPLASH-01)
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — Replace Radix ScrollArea with native overflow div (FIX-01)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 12: Stat Block + Bestiary Data Quality
**Goal**: Creature ability descriptions are human-readable instead of raw Foundry markup, the stat block shows the complete 17-skill list, and the bestiary sources filter shows recognizable book names
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: STAT-01, STAT-02, BEST-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Ability descriptions in the stat block render @UUID, @Damage, @Check, @Template, and @Localize tokens as formatted human-readable text — no raw `@` markup is visible to the user
  2. The stat block skills section lists all 17 PF2e skills with their calculated modifiers — skills not present in Foundry data are derived from creature level + proficiency rank
  3. The bestiary sources filter dropdown shows human-readable book names (e.g., "Player Core", "Monster Core") rather than folder names (e.g., "pf2e", "sf2e")
  4. Selecting a book name in the sources filter correctly narrows the bestiary results to creatures from that source
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 13: Combat UX Sweep
**Goal**: The combat tracker is easier and faster to use — the DM can kill a dying creature in one click, the condition picker shows only combat-relevant conditions in a wider layout, and HP adjustments use a single input with clear action buttons
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: CMB-06, CMB-07, CMB-08, CMB-09, CMB-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The Dying recovery dialog includes a "Kill" button that immediately sets the combatant to dead without requiring a recovery roll
  2. The condition picker does not show Detection conditions (Observed, Hidden, Undetected, Unnoticed) or Attitude conditions (Hostile, Unfriendly, Friendly, Helpful, Indifferent)
  3. The condition picker is wide enough to show conditions in a multi-column grid — the DM can scan and select a condition without scrolling a narrow list
  4. HP controls show one numeric input field and three clearly labeled buttons (Damage / Heal / TempHP) — no separate input fields for each action
  5. The persistent damage modal opens correctly, displays the condition and damage amount, prompts for a flat-check, applies damage on failure, and removes the condition on success
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Condition picker: remove Detection/Attitudes, tabs + grid layout (CMB-07, CMB-08)
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — HP controls: single input + 3 action buttons with split-button damage (CMB-09)
- [x] 13-03-PLAN.md — Verify Kill button + Persistent Damage modal end-to-end (CMB-06, CMB-10)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 14: Stat Block Polish 2
**Goal**: Stat block is fully readable and visually polished — all Foundry token patterns resolved ([[/act]], [[/br]], {Nfeet} area templates), Fighter's Fork has correct weapon data (group=trident, shove trait, Brute Strength extra damage), and the color system makes key stats instantly scannable (section headers, HP, saves, damage types, trait tags, ability text)
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: STAT-01, STAT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. [[/act slug]] tokens render as action name (e.g. "Shove") — no raw [[ ]] markup visible
  2. [[/br expr #label]]{display} tokens render as display text only
  3. {Nfeet} area template tokens render as readable range text (e.g. "30-foot area")
  4. Fighter's Fork strike shows weapon group (trident), shove trait, and Brute Strength extra damage where applicable
  5. Section headers (Strikes, Abilities, Skills) have gradient/themed color treatment
  6. HP, saves, damage type labels, and trait tags each have distinct color coding for instant scanability
  7. Ability description text is visually distinct from ability names (bold names, readable body text)
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### 🚧 v0.5.0-pre-alpha — Combat Redesign + Spells

**Milestone Goal:** Redesign combat tracker into a 3-panel layout (Bestiary | Initiative+Detail | Stat Card), make Encounters the persistent source of truth for combat state, and add a complete spell system — import 1,797 spells from Foundry VTT, display spellcasting in stat blocks, add a spell catalog page, and track spell slot usage per encounter with non-destructive custom spell overrides.

- [ ] **Phase 15: Combat Tracker Layout Redesign** — New 3-panel layout with merged initiative+detail center, bestiary left, creature stat card right
- [x] **Phase 16: Encounter Persistence** — Encounters store creature lists; "Load into Combat" populates tracker; HP/conditions/slots save back to encounter SQLite
 (completed 2026-04-02)
- [x] **Phase 17: Spell Import Pipeline** — Parse 1,797 Foundry VTT spell files into SQLite; parse creature spellcasting entries and prepared spell lists (completed 2026-04-02)
- [x] **Phase 18: Spell Display + Catalog** — Spellcasting section in stat block (tradition, DC, attack, spells by rank); standalone Spells catalog page with FTS5 + filters (completed 2026-04-02)
- [x] **Phase 19: Spell Slot Tracking + Custom Override** — Per-encounter slot pip UI (click to toggle); slot state in encounter SQLite; custom spell add/remove per encounter (non-destructive) (completed 2026-04-02)

### Phase 15: Combat Tracker Layout Redesign
**Goal**: The combat tracker renders as 3 panels — Bestiary search (left), merged initiative list + creature detail (center), creature stat card (right) — and selecting a combatant in the initiative list updates both the center detail view and the right stat card simultaneously
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Requirements**: CMBL-01, CMBL-02, CMBL-03, CMBL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The combat tracker page renders 3 resizable panels: bestiary search left, merged initiative+detail center, stat card right — with no separate "detail panel" modal or tab switch needed
  2. The center panel shows the initiative order list at the top and the selected creature's HP controls, conditions, and turn buttons below it — both visible at once without scrolling off-screen
  3. Clicking any row in the initiative list selects that combatant and immediately updates the right panel to show that creature's full stat block (same stat block as Bestiary)
  4. The bestiary search left panel is functional — DM can search creatures and add them to the initiative list from the same panel without a modal
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Restructure CombatPage into 3-panel layout: Bestiary left, Initiative+Detail center (nested vertical), Stat Card right; lazy NPC stat block fetch with sticky panel + in-memory cache (CMBL-01, CMBL-02, CMBL-03, CMBL-04)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 16: Encounter Persistence
**Goal**: Encounters become the source of truth for combat state — each saved encounter stores its creature list, and the combat tracker loads from an encounter rather than managing creatures independently; combat HP/condition changes write back to encounter SQLite
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: ENCP-01, ENCP-02, ENCP-03, ENCP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Creating an encounter in the Encounters page allows adding creatures to a persistent creature list — the list survives app restart
  2. Clicking "Load into Combat" on a saved encounter navigates to the combat tracker pre-populated with that encounter's creature list, correct HP, and weak/elite tiers
  3. Dealing damage to a combatant in the tracker writes the updated HP to the encounter's SQLite record in real time — reopening the encounter shows the updated HP
  4. Clicking "Reset Encounter" restores all combatants to their initial HP, clears all conditions, and marks all spell slots as available
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 16-01-PLAN.md — DB migration (encounters/encounter_combatants/encounter_conditions tables) + shared/api/encounters.ts + Encounter entity type expansion (ENCP-01..04 foundation)
- [ ] 16-02-PLAN.md — EncountersPage split layout: SavedEncounterList + EncounterEditor + EncounterCreatureSearchPanel with [W][+][E] add (ENCP-01)
- [ ] 16-03-PLAN.md — Load into Combat + encounter write-back auto-save + Reset Encounter (ENCP-02, ENCP-03, ENCP-04)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 17: Spell Import Pipeline
**Goal**: All 1,797 Foundry VTT spells are stored in SQLite and accessible by the frontend; spellcasting entries and prepared spell lists for NPC creatures are parsed and linked to creature records
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: SPLI-01, SPLI-02, SPLI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After running sync, the `spells` table contains 1,700+ rows with foundry_id, name, rank, traditions, traits, description, damage, area, range, duration, action_cost, save_stat, and source_book populated
  2. Spellcaster NPC creatures (e.g. Death Tower Necromancer) have their spellcasting entries stored — tradition "arcane", cast_type "prepared", DC 29, attack +21, slots for ranks 0–5
  3. The prepared spell list for the Death Tower Necromancer can be queried from SQLite and returns the correct spells for each rank as shown in the Foundry JSON
**Plans**: 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md — DB migration: spells + creature_spellcasting_entries + creature_spell_lists tables with FTS5 (SPLI-01..03 foundation)
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md — Spell extraction from entity raw_json + creature spellcasting parse + shared/api/spells.ts query functions (SPLI-01, SPLI-02, SPLI-03)

### Phase 18: Spell Display + Catalog
**Goal**: Spellcaster creatures show their spellcasting section in the stat block with expandable spell cards, and a new Spells page lets the DM browse and search all 1,797 imported spells
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: SPLD-01, SPLD-02, SPLD-03, SPLC-01, SPLC-02, SPLC-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Opening the Death Tower Necromancer's stat block shows a "Spellcasting" section with "Arcane Prepared" badge, DC 29, attack +21, and spells grouped by rank (Cantrips through Rank 5)
  2. Clicking a spell name in the stat block expands it inline showing area, range, duration, damage formula, save type, traits, and heightening rules
  3. The Spells page loads with all imported spells listed; typing a spell name in the search box filters results via FTS5 in under 200ms
  4. Filtering by tradition "arcane" and rank "5" shows only arcane rank-5 spells
**Plans**: 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md — SpellcastingSection type + fetchCreatureStatBlockData async loader (SPLD-01..03 foundation)
- [x] 18-02-PLAN.md — SpellcastingBlock + SpellCard in CreatureStatBlock; full SpellsPage with FTS5 search + tradition/rank filters (SPLD-01, SPLD-02, SPLD-03, SPLC-01, SPLC-02, SPLC-03)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 19: Spell Slot Tracking + Custom Override
**Goal**: The DM can track which spell slots have been used for each spellcasting creature in an encounter, and can non-destructively customize a creature's prepared spell list for a specific encounter
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: SLOT-01, SLOT-02, SLOT-03, CUST-01, CUST-02, CUST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The creature stat card in the combat tracker shows spell slots for each rank as clickable pips (e.g. ●●○○ for 2 used out of 4); clicking a pip toggles it used/available
  2. After marking slots used and switching away from the combat tab, returning shows the same slot state — stored in encounter SQLite, not lost on navigation
  3. From the Encounters page, the DM can open a creature's spell override editor, search for a spell by name, and add it to a rank — the encounter's combat load reflects the addition without modifying the base creature
  4. Removing a spell from a prepared list in the override editor removes it from that encounter's display only — the creature's base spells in the `creatures` table are unchanged
**Plans**: 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 19-01-PLAN.md — DB migration: encounter_spell_slots + encounter_combatant_spells; API functions in encounters.ts (SLOT-01..03, CUST-01..03 foundation)
- [x] 19-02-PLAN.md — SlotPips + AddSpellRow + SpellcastingBlock extended with encounterContext; CombatPage wired (SLOT-01, SLOT-02, SLOT-03, CUST-01, CUST-02, CUST-03)
**UI hint**: yes

  2. FTS5 search on items returns results within 200ms for a name query against the full dataset
  3. A spellcaster NPC (e.g. Death Tower Necromancer) has its carried equipment (armor, weapons, consumables) queryable from `creature_items` by creature_id
**Plans**: 2 plans

  3. Creatures with no equipment do not show the Equipment section
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 22-01-PLAN.md — fetchStatBlock extended with getCreatureItems; EquipmentBlock component in CreatureStatBlock
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 23: Encounter Inventory Editor
**Goal**: The DM can add or remove items from a creature's inventory for a specific encounter without modifying the base creature data
**Depends on**: Phase 22
**Requirements**: ENCINV-01, ENCINV-02, ENCINV-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. In encounter context, each item in the Equipment section has a hover-revealed × button; clicking it hides the item for that encounter only (base creature unchanged)
  2. An "Add Item" search row at the bottom of Equipment (encounter context only) lets the DM search and add any item from the catalog; it appears in the combat stat card immediately
  3. After resetting the encounter, all item overrides are cleared and the creature's base inventory is restored
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 23-01-PLAN.md — DB migration: encounter_combatant_items; API in encounters.ts; EquipmentBlock extended with encounterContext
**UI hint**: yes

**Depends on**: Phase 21
**Requirements**: ATRES-01, ATRES-02, ATRES-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment.Item.X] without alias renders as the item's name, not the raw ID
  2. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.X] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditions.Item.X] similarly resolve to names

**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 24-01-PLAN.md — resolveFoundryTokensAsync in mappers.ts; post-processing pass in sync.ts to resolve unaliased @UUID links; audit queries

**Depends on**: Phase 32
**Requirements**: null
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. FTS5 search returns correct results with no count flicker — stale results cleared before new results shown
  2. All active filters (type, level, rarity, traits, source, subcategory) apply in a single DB round-trip
  3. Favorites tab shows favorited items grouped by category in collapsible sections; star toggle persists to `item_favorites` SQLite table

### 🚧 v0.9.6-pre-alpha — МАТЕМАТИКА (Dice Rolling + Condition Math)

**Milestone Goal:** Implement PF2e dice rolling system (d20 + modifier, damage formulas with crit/full/half) with a simple rotating cube animation and session-only roll history, then wire the engine's modifier/statistics math to auto-apply condition penalties (Frightened, Clumsy, etc.) to the combat tracker UI.

- [x] **Phase 36: Roll Foundation** — RollStore (Zustand, session-only), dice formula parser (`2d6+4`), `rollDice()` utility, base Roll types. Pure TS, no UI. (completed 2026-04-04)
- [x] **Phase 37: Dice UI + History** — Rotating cube animation (CSS/JS), RollResultToast, RollHistoryPanel (collapsible, clearable) (completed 2026-04-04)
- [ ] **Phase 38: Clickable Rolls** — All attack modifiers + damage formulas clickable; crit/full/half display for save-based damage; MAP counter per combatant per round
- [ ] **Phase 39: Condition Math** — Wire engine `modifiers/` + `statistics/` to combat tracker; auto-apply Frightened/Clumsy/etc. penalties; show modified values in UI

### Phase 36: Roll Foundation
**Goal**: Session-only RollStore (Zustand), dice formula parser (`"2d6+4"` → parsed parts), `rollDice(formula)` utility that resolves to individual die results + total, and typed Roll interfaces — all pure TypeScript with zero UI
**Depends on**: Phase 35
**Requirements**: null
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `rollDice("2d6+4")` returns individual die values, modifier, and total — deterministic when seeded, random in production
  2. RollStore holds session-only roll history (array of Roll records), clearable, no persistence
  3. Formula parser handles all PF2e damage patterns: `1d6`, `2d8+5`, `1d4+1d6`, negative modifiers, zero
  4. Roll types are exported from the engine or a shared types file — no circular imports
  5. No UI code in this phase — pure TS utilities and Zustand store only
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 36-01-PLAN.md — engine/dice/dice.ts (parser + rollDice + heightenFormula + Roll types) + engine barrel export + src/shared/model/roll-store.ts (Zustand session store with MAP tracking)

### Phase 37: Dice UI + History
**Goal**: Rotating cube animation component, RollResultToast showing die breakdown + total, and RollHistoryPanel (collapsible, clearable) integrated into the app layout
**Depends on**: Phase 36
**Requirements**: null
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Cube animation plays when a roll is triggered — simple fast-spin CSS effect, not a full 3D sim
  2. RollResultToast shows: formula, individual die values, modifier, total — dismissible
  3. RollHistoryPanel shows all rolls for the session; clearable; collapsible
  4. Panel integrated into combat page layout without breaking existing panels
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 37-01-PLAN.md — DiceCubeAnimation + RollResultToast + RollToastListener + RollDie20Button (shared/ui components + CSS keyframes)
- [x] 37-02-PLAN.md — RollHistoryPanel widget + AppHeader integration (global dice UI wiring)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 38: Clickable Rolls
**Goal**: All attack modifiers in the combat tracker are clickable (d20 + hit_bonus), damage formulas clickable with crit/full/half variants for save-based damage, MAP counter tracks attacks per combatant per round
**Depends on**: Phase 37
**Requirements**: null
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every attack bonus in the stat block / combat tracker is clickable → triggers d20 + modifier roll
  2. Damage formulas clickable → triggers damage roll with breakdown
  3. Save-based damage shows three variants: Critical Hit (2×), Full, Half — user picks which to apply
  4. MAP counter visible per combatant; clicking attack auto-increments MAP; MAP penalty applied to next roll
  5. Spell/effect damage formulas clickable with the same crit/full/half UI

### Phase 39: Condition Math
**Goal**: Engine `modifiers/` + `statistics/` wired to combat tracker — condition penalties (Frightened, Clumsy, Drained, Enfeebled, Stupefied, Stunned) auto-applied to displayed attack/skill/save modifiers in the UI
**Depends on**: Phase 38
**Requirements**: null
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Frightened N → -N status penalty applied to all checks and DCs
  2. Clumsy N → -N status penalty to DEX-based rolls and AC
  3. Enfeebled N → -N status penalty to STR-based rolls
  4. Drained N → -N status penalty to CON-based rolls
  5. Modified values shown in UI (with tooltip showing base + penalty breakdown)
  6. Engine modifier stacking rules respected (status penalties don't stack)

## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Stat block card in combat tracker (FULFILLED)

**Goal:** Integrate the bestiary stat block card into the combat tracker — clicking a combatant in the tracker opens the same full stat block (with MAP, IWR, abilities, etc.) that's shown in the bestiary browser
**Status:** Fulfilled in Phase 15 (3-panel layout with stat card right panel)
**Plans:** Delivered as part of Phase 15-01-PLAN.md

### Phase 40: Dice Rolls Extended

**Depends on**: Phase 41
**Requirements**: PCImp-01, PCImp-02, PCImp-03, PCImp-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `characters` table exists after migration with columns: id, name, class, level, ancestry, raw_json (TEXT), notes (TEXT), created_at
  2. Importing a valid Pathbuilder JSON (file or paste) stores the PC — re-import with same name updates the record
  3. `calculatePCMaxHP(build)` returns correct value: ancestryhp + (classhp + bonushp + CON_mod) × level
  4. `shared/api/characters.ts` exports: getAllCharacters, getCharacterById, upsertCharacter, deleteCharacter, updateCharacterNotes
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

### Phase 43: Characters Page
**Goal**: DM can browse all imported PCs, import new ones, delete, and add to active combat from the Characters page
**Depends on**: Phase 42
**Requirements**: CHAR-01, CHAR-02, CHAR-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `/characters` route shows all PCs as cards with name, class, level, ancestry visible

  3. Deleting a PC removes it from the list (with confirmation prompt)
  4. "Add to Combat" button on a PC card adds it to the active encounter in combat tracker
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
**UI hint**: yes

  5. Feats & Features panel shows feats list (with type and level) and class specials
  6. DM notes field is editable inline and saves on blur/enter — persists to SQLite
**Plans:** TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 45: Combat Integration
**Goal**: PCs can be added to the combat tracker and tracked identically to NPCs — initiative, HP/tempHP, conditions, turn advancement; no spell/item overrides
**Depends on**: Phase 43
**Requirements**: CMB-01, CMB-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. PC added to combat tracker appears with calculated max HP, AC displayed, PC badge visually distinct from NPC rows
  2. PC participates in turn order, HP/tempHP controls work identically to NPC, conditions can be added/removed
  3. No encounter override UI appears for PCs — no spell slot tracking, no item override buttons

**Depends on**: Phase 45
**Requirements**: POLISH-01 (v1.0.0 late addition)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Left panel has 3 toggle tabs: Bestiary, Hazards, Characters — active tab highlighted
  2. Selecting a PC in combat tracker shows PCCombatCard in right panel (not NPC stat block)
  3. Initiative values are editable inline for both NPCs and PCs
  4. "Add to Combat" on Characters page shows encounter picker when multiple encounters are open
  5. Hazard rows in combat tracker have a roll-initiative button
**Plans:** 4/4 plans complete

### v1.3.0 — Encounter Import + Combat UX Refinement (SHIPPED 2026-04-19)

Archived — see `.planning/milestones/v1.3.0-ROADMAP.md`

<details><summary>v1.3.0 phase details</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Encounter import, combat entry flow, effect/spellcasting UX polish, rules engine regressions

- [ ] **Phase 60: Effect Rules Engine Fix** — FlatModifier `attack` selector regression + audit PF2e canonical selectors
- [ ] **Phase 61: Effect Picker UX** — Widened modal, category groups, context-filtered default, global search, live-refresh
- [ ] **Phase 62: Spellcasting UX Refactor** — Informational slots, edit mode, unified component
- [ ] **Phase 63: Combat Entry Flow + Refresh Semantics** — Encounter-as-template, Start gate, Info panel, dedup dialog
- [ ] **Phase 64: Encounter Import** — Pathmaiden JSON + Pathfinder Dashboard JSON, preview dialog

### Phase 60: Effect Rules Engine Fix
**Goal**: Исправить регрессию — FlatModifier с selector: "attack" (Bane и подобные) корректно применяется к attack rolls; провести аудит покрытия PF2e canonical selectors в engine selector resolver
**Depends on**: Nothing (engine-only, no UI dependencies)
**Requirements**: EFFECT-RULES-01, EFFECT-RULES-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Применив Bane к комбатанту в combat tracker, пользователь видит -1 status penalty на Strike-атаках этого комбатанта
  2. Все PF2e canonical селекторы (attack, ac, all-saves, fortitude, reflex, will, skill-check, damage, spell-attack, spell-dc, class-dc) обрабатываются явно в resolveSingleSelector
  3. pnpm tsc --noEmit и pnpm lint — 0 ошибок
**Plans:** 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 60-01-PLAN.md — Selector-resolver canonical cases (attack/all-saves/skill-check/spell-attack/class-dc/damage) + spell-attack virtual slug в UI

</details>

### v1.4.0 — Effects Deep Dive + PC Library + UX Unification (SHIPPED 2026-04-20)

Archived — see `.planning/milestones/v1.4.0-ROADMAP.md`

<details><summary>v1.4.0 phase details</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Вывести движок эффектов PF2e за пределы FlatModifier/Resistance — поддержка RollOption/AdjustStrike/BattleForm/Note/GrantItem + predicate evaluator для условных модификаторов. Унифицировать Spellcasting UI между combat detail и custom creature builder. Cast→Target→Apply flow с multi-target. Paizo iconics + adventure pregens как готовые PC/NPC. Encounter export в Pathmaiden JSON.

- [ ] **Phase 65: Rule Engine Expansion** — RollOption / AdjustStrike / BattleForm / Note / GrantItem + pack coverage audit
- [ ] **Phase 66: Predicate Evaluator** — DSL parser + state bridge + integration into modifier pipeline (Acid Grip regression)
- [ ] **Phase 67: Spellcasting UX Unification** — Shared SpellcastingEditor component used by combat detail and custom creature builder
- [ ] **Phase 68: Cast → Target → Apply Flow** — Cast button, target picker with allegiance, multi-target, applies parent effect + consumes slot
- [ ] **Phase 69: Encounter Export** — .pathmaiden JSON download from /encounters page + round-trip re-import
- [ ] **Phase 70: Paizo Library Import** — Iconics + adventure pregens synced as both NPC and PC, with source filter in pickers

### Phase 65: Rule Engine Expansion
**Goal**: Effects beyond FlatModifier/Resistance apply mechanically — RollOption/AdjustStrike/BattleForm/Note/GrantItem rule types are implemented in the engine pipeline, and every rule type present in the 3 allow-listed packs has engine support or is explicitly logged as ignored
**Depends on**: Nothing (engine work, no cross-phase deps inside v1.4)
**Requirements**: RULE-01, RULE-02, RULE-03, RULE-04, RULE-05, RULE-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Apply Sure Strike to a combatant → the next Strike roll uses fortune (2d20 keep highest); apply Assurance → the next skill check resolves to the flat DC value
  2. Apply Enlarge → the combatant's damage tooltip shows one step up on a selected damage die AND the combatant's size badge increments one category
  3. Apply an effect carrying a Note rule → the RollResultToast shows the note text attached to matching rolls
  4. Apply Rage (GrantItem parent) → the granted sub-effect appears in the Effects section automatically and its modifiers stack correctly
  5. An audit report lists every rule type found across spell-effects / equipment-effects / boons-and-curses packs with counts and "supported | ignored" status
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 66: Predicate Evaluator
**Goal**: Conditional modifiers fire only when their predicate holds against live combatant state — the DSL parser, state bridge, and modifier pipeline integration all work end-to-end
**Depends on**: Phase 65 (extends the modifier pipeline rule-types now emit into)
**Requirements**: PRED-01, PRED-02, PRED-03, PRED-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Predicates with nested {and,or,not} combinators and self:/target:/item: atoms parse without crashes and evaluate deterministically
  2. For any combatant, the state bridge exposes live facts — active conditions (with values), effect slugs, creature traits, persistent-damage types — that predicates can query
  3. A FlatModifier with an unmet predicate is absent from the net-total; the modifier tooltip shows "inactive — requires X" with the specific failing atom
  4. Acid Grip regression: applying persistent acid damage to the target live-enables its -10 speed penalty; removing persistent acid live-disables it without resetting the effect
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 67: Spellcasting UX Unification
**Goal**: Spellcasting editing lives in one component used by two callsites — combat detail (DB-backed) and custom creature builder (reducer-backed) — with no persistence branching inside the shared code
**Depends on**: Nothing (UI refactor, independent of rule-engine work)
**Requirements**: SPELLCAST-U-01, SPELLCAST-U-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. features/spellcasting-editor/ exports one SpellcastingEditor component that renders slot editor + spell list editor + rank editor
  2. CombatantDetail spellcasting section uses the shared component and persists edits through encounter_slot_overrides and encounter_combatant_spells unchanged
  3. Custom Creature Builder SpellcastingTab uses the same component and persists edits through the existing reducer — no duplicate UI code remains
  4. The shared component receives all persistence via props/callbacks; grep for encounter_ or creatureReducer inside features/spellcasting-editor/ returns nothing
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 68: Cast → Target → Apply Flow
**Goal**: Casting a spell that carries a linked effect becomes a single GM action — click Cast, pick target(s), effect is applied and the slot is consumed
**Depends on**: Phase 67 (hosts the Cast button on the unified spellcasting surface)
**Requirements**: APPLY-01, APPLY-02, APPLY-03, APPLY-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. In CombatantDetail, spell rows with a linked spell_effects row render a Cast button; spell rows without linked effects do not
  2. Clicking Cast opens a target picker listing current-encounter combatants grouped as PCs / NPC allies / NPC enemies relative to the caster, with a sensible default (buffs → allies, debuffs → enemies) and manual override
  3. For a 3-action Heal (or any spell whose metadata declares target count >1) the picker switches to checkbox mode honoring the declared max; single-target spells stay single-select
  4. Committing the selection applies the parent effect to each chosen target via the existing applyEffectToCombatant path and consumes the caster's slot via the existing used_count / prepared-cast plumbing
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 69: Encounter Export
**Goal**: Any saved encounter can be downloaded as a shareable .pathmaiden JSON and re-imported losslessly in another install
**Depends on**: Nothing (parser shipped in v1.3 Phase 64)
**Requirements**: EXPORT-01, EXPORT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each encounter card on /encounters page has an Export action that downloads a .pathmaiden file conforming to the pathmaiden-v1 schema
  2. Re-importing the exported file via the existing Import button reconstructs the combatant list (bestiary / custom / hazard) matched by name with correct display names, HP, initiative, and weak/elite tiering
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 70: Paizo Library Import
**Goal**: Paizo iconics and adventure pregens are available as both pre-built NPCs and importable PCs, discoverable in the sidebar and character picker with a source filter
**Depends on**: Nothing (sync-pipeline extension, independent of everything else)
**Requirements**: LIBRARY-01, LIBRARY-02, LIBRARY-03, LIBRARY-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After sync, the Bestiary contains the full set of iconics (Amiri, Ezren, Feiya, Harsk, Kyra, Lem, Lini, Merisiel, Sajan, …) with full stat blocks, AND the Characters page shows the same iconics as PCs with PCSheet rendering without crashes
  2. After sync, each paizo-pregens/<adventure>/ subfolder appears as both NPC entries in the Bestiary and PC records on Characters page, tagged with their adventure source
  3. CreatureSearchSidebar and the character picker both surface iconics/pregens alongside bestiary/custom entries, with a source filter chip that narrows to iconics only or to a single adventure's pregens
  4. Imported PC data preserves class / level / ancestry / feats / equipment / spells where the JSON provides them; missing fields fall back to safe defaults and PCSheet renders without crashes
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### 🚧 v1.7.0 — Monster Translation (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Load-time HTML→structured парсер для RU-переводов монстров; `CreatureStatBlock` отображает RU текст в ability cards / skills / saves / speeds / strikes с fallback на EN. Runtime без парсинга.

- [x] **Phase 84: HTML Parser Library** — `parseMonsterRuHtml(text, rus_text)` pure TS + native DOMParser; unit coverage на Succubus + 5 other monsters (completed 2026-04-23)
- [x] **Phase 85: Migration + DB Schema** — `0041_translation_structured_json.sql`: rename `0038_translations.sql` → `0041_translations.sql` + add `structured_json TEXT NULL` column (completed 2026-04-23)
- [x] **Phase 86: Bundled Loader Integration** — parser дёргается при seed translations table; structured_json populated; graceful degradation на malformed HTML (completed 2026-04-24)
- [x] **Phase 87: API + Hook Extension** — `shared/api/translations.ts` возвращает typed `structured` field; `useContentTranslation` surface'ит его consumers; backward compat для существующих consumers (completed 2026-04-24)
- [ ] **Phase 88: CreatureStatBlock Overlay Wiring** — ability cards / skills / saves / speeds / strikes / spellcasting heading читают structured RU с EN fallback
- [ ] **Phase 89: Tech Debt — use-spellcasting Trim** — `use-spellcasting.ts` <100 строк (carryover из v1.6.0 audit)
- [ ] **DEBT-02 (process)** — Per-phase SUMMARY.md / VERIFICATION.md / UAT.md дисциплина восстановлена для каждой v1.7.0 фазы (reinstates dropped-in-v1.6.0 practice)

## Phase Details

### Phase 84: HTML Parser Library
**Goal**: Pure TS модуль `parseMonsterRuHtml(textEn, rusText)` извлекает структурированный RU из HTML пары. Zero new deps, native DOMParser.
**Depends on**: Nothing (parser изолирован, не зависит от DB/schema)
**Requirements**: TRANS-01
**Files**: `src/shared/i18n/pf2e-content/lib/parse-monster.ts` (new), `src/shared/i18n/pf2e-content/lib/types.ts` (new with `MonsterStructuredLoc` type)
**Success Criteria**:
1. Parser не бросает на HTML из всех записей в `monster.json` — graceful `null` на malformed
2. Для Succubus: корректно извлекает 5 ability blocks (Seductive Presence, Rejection Vulnerability, Change Shape, Embrace, Passionate Kiss, Profane Gift), strike (когти +16), skills (7 навыков), saves, speeds (25/35), spellcasting heading, HP (100), AC (23), weaknesses (cold iron 5, holy 5)
4. EN↔RU matching: positional index-based primary strategy; bolded-name normalized match as fallback
5. Pure TS, no React imports, no new npm deps
6. Unit tests в `parse-monster.test.ts` — Succubus + 5 other monsters (можно добавить в `monster.json` для теста) — 100% parse success

### Phase 85: Migration + DB Schema
**Goal**: DB готова принимать structured_json. Prefix collision с Phase 79 migration разрешена.
**Depends on**: Phase 84 (type shape known before column can be designed)
**Requirements**: TRANS-02
**Files**: `src/shared/db/migrations/0041_translation_structured_json.sql` (new), `src/shared/db/migrations/0038_translations.sql` → renamed to `src/shared/db/migrations/0041_translations.sql` (or delete+recreate depending on `import.meta.glob` load order), `src/shared/db/schema/translations.ts` (Drizzle schema update)
**Success Criteria**:
1. Fresh install: migrations применяются без конфликтов, `translations.structured_json` column существует, nullable
2. Existing install: migration 0041 применяется идемпотентно; legacy translations rows имеют `structured_json IS NULL` (backfill в Phase 86 seed)
3. `import.meta.glob` находит все migrations в новом порядке; нет дубликата `0038_*`
4. Drizzle `db.select().from(translations)` type включает `structuredJson: string | null`
5. `tsc --noEmit` = 0, `pnpm lint:arch` = 0

### Phase 86: Bundled Loader Integration
**Goal**: При seed `pf2e-content/monster.json` в DB парсер вызывается и результат сохраняется в `structured_json`. Legacy `name_loc`/`traits_loc`/`text_loc` продолжают работать unchanged.
**Depends on**: Phase 84 (parser must exist), Phase 85 (DB column must exist)
**Requirements**: TRANS-03
**Files**: `src/shared/i18n/pf2e-content/index.ts` (extend loader)
**Success Criteria**:
1. Cold app-start: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM translations WHERE kind='monster' AND structured_json IS NOT NULL` > 0
2. Parser exceptions logged via `console.warn`, не ломают loader (loader всё равно seed'ит row с `structured_json=NULL`)
3. Idempotent seed: повторный run не дублирует rows, `structured_json` перезаписывается
4. Performance: seed 100+ monsters < 500ms (native DOMParser fast enough)
5. Non-monster kinds (spell/item/feat/action) — `structured_json` остаётся NULL (scope monster-only)
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 86-01-PLAN.md — Loader parser invocation (guard + try/catch) + 9-column INSERT; migrations.debug A7 assertion (TRANS-03)

### Phase 87: API + Hook Extension
**Goal**: Typed structured data доступна через `useContentTranslation` без парсинга в рантайме.
**Depends on**: Phase 85 (column must exist), Phase 86 (populated with data)
**Requirements**: TRANS-04
**Files**: `src/shared/api/translations.ts` (add `structured` field parsing on read), `src/shared/i18n/use-content-translation.ts` (surface structured), `src/shared/i18n/index.ts` (re-export types)
**Success Criteria**:
1. `useContentTranslation('monster', name, level)` returns `{data: {nameLoc, traitsLoc, textLoc, structured: MonsterStructuredLoc | null}, isLoading, locale}`
2. JSON.parse ошибки в `structured_json` → `structured=null`, консоль-warn, без throw
3. `locale === 'en'` → всё-ещё short-circuit без DB-roundtrip (existing behavior preserved)
4. Zero regressions для существующих consumers (FeatInlineCard / ItemReferenceDrawer / SpellReferenceDrawer / ActionsPage) — они читают только `nameLoc`
5. Types exported из barrel: `MonsterStructuredLoc`, `AbilityLoc`, `SkillLoc`, `StrikeLoc`, etc.
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 87-01-PLAN.md — JSON.parse в toRow + typed structured field; barrel re-exports 7 types; A8 end-to-end assertion (TRANS-04)

### Phase 88: CreatureStatBlock Overlay Wiring
**Goal**: `CreatureStatBlock` показывает RU текст в интерактивных блоках когда structured translation существует. Numeric values / rolls / spellcasting editor интерактивность остаются.
**Depends on**: Phase 87 (hook must surface structured)
**Requirements**: TRANS-05
**Files**: `src/entities/creature/ui/CreatureStatBlock.tsx` (wiring), потенциально под-компоненты (`AbilityCard`, `SkillsRow`, `SavesBlock`, `SpeedsBlock`, `StrikesBlock`) — декомпозиция по FSD (`lib → model → ui`) если CreatureStatBlock.tsx разрастается
**Success Criteria**:
1. Для Succubus @ locale=ru: ability cards показывают RU name + description; skill names RU (Акробатика, Обман, Дипломатия); saves-labels RU (Стойкость, Реакция, Воля); HP/AC labels RU (ПЗ, КБ); speeds RU (футы, полёт); strike name RU (когти); damage type RU (режущий)
2. Цифры (bonus +16, damage 2d8+8, DC 26, skill bonuses) остаются engine-computed; clickable roll surfaces работают
3. Spellcasting block heading RU (`Врождённые сакральные заклинания`); spell names уже переводятся через existing hook
4. Creature без перевода (напр. Foundry-only) — рендер unchanged, EN baseline
5. Creature с legacy nameLoc/traitsLoc но без structured_json — old overlay behavior сохраняется (name+traits RU, остальное EN), без regression
6. `pnpm lint` = 0, `tsc --noEmit` = 0, `pnpm lint:arch` = 0

### Phase 89: Tech Debt — use-spellcasting Trim
**Goal**: `use-spellcasting.ts` facade <100 строк (carryover из v1.6.0 Phase 80 audit).
**Depends on**: Nothing (orthogonal к v1.7.0 main scope; параллельна Phase 84-88)
**Requirements**: DEBT-01
**Files**: `src/features/spellcasting/model/use-spellcasting.ts`, потенциально `src/features/spellcasting/lib/resolve-cast-mode.ts` (new), `src/features/spellcasting/model/use-spellcasting-progress.ts` (new sub-hook)
**Success Criteria**:
1. `use-spellcasting.ts` < 100 lines (currently 119)
2. Zero user-visible regressions — все v1.6.0 spellcasting сценарии (prepared/innate/spontaneous/focus) проходят без изменений
3. `resolveCastMode` extracted в pure helper в `features/spellcasting/lib/`
4. Sub-hook остаётся в `features/spellcasting/model/`, follows `useShallow` + `useMemo` conventions
5. 0 `useState` в facade (был инвариант Phase 80)

### v1.7.0 Progress

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 84. HTML Parser Library | 2/2 | Complete    | 2026-04-23 |
| 85. Migration + DB Schema | 1/1 | Complete    | 2026-04-24 |
| 86. Bundled Loader Integration | 1/1 | Complete    | 2026-04-24 |
| 87. API + Hook Extension | 1/1 | Complete   | 2026-04-24 |
| 88. CreatureStatBlock Overlay Wiring | 0/? | Not started | — |
| 89. use-spellcasting Trim | 0/? | Not started | — |

**Parallelization hint:** Phase 84 + Phase 89 можно гнать параллельно (разные файлы, orthogonal). Phase 85-88 — strict sequence (Phase 85 → 86 → 87 → 88 dep chain).
