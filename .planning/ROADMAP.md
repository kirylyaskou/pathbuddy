## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Cleanup + Architecture
**Goal**: Codebase is engine-only — all UI deleted, PWOL removed, PF2e modules live in `/engine` with clean barrel exports and zero UI dependencies
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CLN-01, CLN-02, ARCH-01, ARCH-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. No Vue components, views, stores, composables, router files, or styles exist anywhere in the repo
  2. No PWOL references exist in any engine module or config file
  3. All PF2e modules (xp.ts, damage.ts, modifiers.ts, damage-helpers.ts, iwr.ts, conditions.ts) are under `/engine`
  4. `/engine/index.ts` barrel export exists and imports nothing from UI, Tauri, Pinia, or Vue
**Plans:** 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Delete all UI code, Tauri backend, non-engine files; strip PWOL from XP module
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Relocate engine to /engine with domain subdirectories; create barrel export; configure project

### Phase 2: Reference Analysis
**Goal**: The gap between the current engine and the Foundry VTT PF2e system is fully documented — every missing mechanic identified and prioritized
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: ANAL-01, ANAL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A gap-analysis document exists describing what the `refs/` repo implements vs. what `/engine` currently covers
  2. A prioritized list of missing mechanics (conditions, statuses, actions) exists with notes on which are essential for DM use
**Plans:** 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Analyze refs/pf2e/ across 12 PF2e domains; produce GAP-ANALYSIS.md with prioritized missing-mechanics list

### Phase 3: Conditions & Statuses
**Goal**: The engine implements the complete set of PF2e conditions and statuses identified as missing in Phase 2 analysis
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: ENG-01
**Note**: Scope is intentionally high-level — exact mechanics are determined by Phase 2 gap analysis
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All conditions and statuses flagged as missing in the gap-analysis document are implemented in `/engine`
  2. Each implemented condition matches Foundry VTT PF2e source behavior for its value range, cascade rules, and group exclusivity
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 4: Actions & Modifier Math
**Goal**: The engine implements missing actions from analysis and produces correct final modifier values for all bonus and penalty combinations
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: ENG-02, ENG-03
**Note**: Scope is intentionally high-level — exact actions are determined by Phase 2 gap analysis
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All actions flagged as missing in the gap-analysis document are implemented in `/engine`
  2. Typed bonuses stack by taking the highest bonus and lowest penalty per type (not summing all)
  3. Untyped bonuses stack additively
  4. A given set of modifiers produces the same final value as the Foundry VTT PF2e reference implementation for that modifier combination
**Plans:** 4 plans
Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Type foundations: expanded Creature interface, Action type system, degree-of-success module, performRecoveryCheck refactor
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Action data: ingest 545 entries from refs/, hand-code ~40 combat outcome descriptors
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Statistic system: Statistic class, selector resolver, CreatureStatistics adapter, condition auto-injection, MAP attack sets
- [x] 04-04-PLAN.md — Barrel export: wire all Phase 4 modules into engine/index.ts

### Phase 5: Vite Scaffold + Next.js Teardown
**Goal**: The project runs as a Tauri 2 + Vite 6 + React 19 SPA in dev mode — all Next.js artifacts eliminated, routing scaffolded with createHashRouter, and the full PF2e dark fantasy design system rendering correctly
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: FND-01, FND-02, FND-03, FND-04, FND-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `npm run tauri dev` starts the app without errors; all page routes render a placeholder without crashing
  2. Navigating between routes works via React Router v7 hash-based links — no `next/link`, `usePathname`, or `useRouter` imports survive anywhere in src/
  3. All PF2e OKLCH color tokens (`bg-pf-gold`, `text-pf-threat-extreme`, `bg-sidebar`, etc.) render correctly in the app — the dark fantasy UI is visually intact
  4. All 60+ shadcn/ui Radix components are importable and render without errors in Vite (rsc: false, no SSR)
  5. `steiger` FSD linter and `eslint-plugin-boundaries` run on `npm run lint` and enforce layer import direction with zero false negatives
**Plans:** 3/3 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Scaffold Tauri 2 + Vite 6 project infrastructure, install deps, create PF2e OKLCH design system
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Initialize shadcn/ui, copy 64 components, create hash router with 8 pages, port navigation shell
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Wire steiger + eslint-plugin-boundaries FSD linting, visual verification checkpoint
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 6: FSD Structure + Zustand Stores
**Goal**: The codebase is organized under FSD layers with all Zustand stores designed and stubbed — entity state (SQLite-derived, serializable) is separated from feature runtime state (session, in-memory), and the @engine alias and shared/api/ IPC boundary are live
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: ARCH-03, ARCH-04, ARCH-05, ARCH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All source files live under `app/`, `pages/`, `widgets/`, `features/`, `entities/`, or `shared/` — no files remain in legacy prototype directories
  2. Entity stores (`entities/creature/`, `entities/combatant/`, `entities/condition/`, `entities/encounter/`) hold only serializable SQLite-derived data; feature stores hold only session runtime state — no store mixes both
  3. Every `invoke()` call in the codebase is inside `shared/api/` — zero `invoke()` calls exist in features/, widgets/, or pages/
  4. `import('@engine/...')` resolves correctly in both `features/` and `entities/` layers via `vite-tsconfig-paths`; `eslint-plugin-boundaries` reports no violations
**Plans:** 4/4 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Install zustand + immer; create shared/api/ IPC boundary with stubbed creature/combat/db wrappers
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Create 4 full entity slices (creature, combatant, condition, encounter) with Zustand stores; move PF2e components to entity ui/ segments
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Create 3 minimal entity skeletons (spell, item, hazard) with type stubs and barrel exports
- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md — Create 3 feature slice stores (combat-tracker, bestiary-browser, encounter-builder); ARCH-04 human-verify checkpoint

### Phase 7: SQLite + Foundry VTT Data Pipeline
**Goal**: The app reads real Foundry VTT entity data from SQLite — migrations run before React mounts, the sync pipeline imports 28K+ entities, FTS5 full-text search works across all entity types, and the mock data file is gone
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04, DATA-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The splash screen completes DB migration before React Router mounts — no route renders before the schema is current
  2. Triggering Foundry VTT sync downloads the latest release ZIP and upserts 28K+ entities into SQLite without errors
  3. Typing a creature name in FTS5 search returns matching results in under 200ms with the full 28K+ entity dataset loaded
  4. `src/lib/pf2e-data.ts` (or equivalent mock data file) does not exist anywhere in the codebase — `git ls-files | grep pf2e-data` returns nothing
**Plans:** 5/5 plans created
Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Tauri SQL plugin + DB schema + migrations + entity type fixes (DATA-01)
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Rust sync command: download ZIP, extract JSON, return entities (DATA-02)
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Splash screen gate component with branded PF2e aesthetic (DATA-04)
- [x] 07-04-PLAN.md — Frontend sync pipeline + FTS5 search queries (DATA-02, DATA-03)
- [ ] 07-05-PLAN.md — Settings page sync UI + mock data cleanup (DATA-02, DATA-05)

### Phase 8: Combat Tracker + Engine Integration
**Goal**: The DM can run a full combat encounter — adding creatures from the bestiary, tracking initiative order, adjusting HP/tempHP, and managing conditions — with the engine ConditionManager handling all PF2e condition rules including auto-decrement at turn end
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: CMB-01, CMB-02, CMB-03, CMB-04, CMB-05, BEST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The DM can search the bestiary, click a creature, and see it appear in the combat tracker with correct initiative slot
  2. Clicking increment/decrement on a combatant's HP updates the value immediately; tempHP absorbs damage before HP and drains first
  3. The DM can add a condition to a combatant from a dropdown and see a badge appear with the correct icon and numeric value for valued conditions (Frightened 2, Sickened 1, etc.)
  4. Clicking "End Turn" for a combatant with Frightened or Sickened automatically decrements the condition value by 1 (or removes it at 0) via engine CONDITION_EFFECTS
  5. The active turn is highlighted; round and turn counters increment correctly when advancing through the initiative order
**Plans:** 4/4 plans created
Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Infrastructure: combat DB schema, @dnd-kit install, store refactors, ConditionManager bridge
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — 3-panel layout + initiative list (DnD) + bestiary search panel + creature/PC add
- [x] 08-03-PLAN.md — Combatant detail panel + HP controls + condition combobox + condition badges
- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md — Turn advancement + auto-decrement + previous turn + toasts + SQLite auto-save
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 9: Bestiary Browser + Encounter Builder
**Goal**: The DM can browse and search 28K+ real PF2e creatures with full stat blocks, and build encounters with a live XP budget bar that uses the engine's encounter rating calculation — not mock functions
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: BEST-01, BEST-02, ENC-01, ENC-02, ENC-03, ENC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The DM can type a name, select level range, creature type, rarity, and source filters — the bestiary list updates immediately with matching Foundry VTT entities
  2. Clicking a creature in the bestiary shows its full stat block: HP, AC, saves, IWR breakdown, strikes, and special abilities — all from real Foundry data, no hardcoded values
  3. Adding a creature to an encounter draft immediately updates the XP budget bar — the bar reflects engine `calculateEncounterRating` output, not a local mock calculation
  4. Changing party size or party level in the encounter config immediately recalculates XP budget and threat rating — the threat label (Trivial / Low / Moderate / Severe / Extreme) updates in real time from the engine
**Plans:** 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Bestiary browser with FTS5 filters, stat block mapper, filter bar, 2-panel page
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Encounter builder with party config persistence, engine XP budget, creature draft
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 10: P2 Differentiators
**Goal**: The engine's unique PF2e capabilities — IWR preview, Dying/Wounded cascade, Weak/Elite presets, persistent damage, MAP attack display, and hazard XP — are surfaced in the UI, giving DMs information no competing tool provides
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: INT-01, INT-02, INT-03, INT-04, INT-05, INT-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When the DM enters a damage value and type in the damage dialog, the UI displays the engine `applyIWR` breakdown (raw damage, immunity/resistance/weakness applied, final damage) before the DM confirms
  2. When a combatant reaches 0 HP, a Dying/Wounded cascade dialog appears; the DM can trigger a recovery check and see the engine `performRecoveryCheck` result (success/failure/critical) with the resulting condition change
  3. When adding a creature from the bestiary to combat, the DM can select Weak or Elite tier — HP adjusts immediately using engine `getHpAdjustment` before the creature enters the tracker
  4. Combatants with persistent damage show a prompt at turn end for a flat-check roll; passing removes the condition, failing deals the persistent damage
  5. The creature stat block displays MAP attack modifier sets (MAP 0 / MAP -5 / MAP -10) computed by engine `buildAttackModifierSets`; hazard entries in the encounter builder contribute XP via engine `getHazardXp`
**Plans:** 4/4 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Weak/Elite tier toggle on creature add + MAP attack display in stat block (INT-03, INT-05)
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — IWR damage preview with type combobox and engine applyIWR breakdown (INT-01)
- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md — Dying/Wounded cascade dialog + persistent damage flat-check toasts (INT-02, INT-04)
- [x] 10-04-PLAN.md — Hazard XP in encounter builder via engine getHazardXp (INT-06)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 11: App Shell Fixes
**Goal**: The app presents a polished first impression and the encounters page loads reliably — no white flash on startup, no crash from the Radix ScrollArea infinite re-render
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: SPLASH-01, FIX-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On app launch the user sees an animated CSS d20 die spinning with rotating D&D/PF2e flavor messages instead of a blank white screen
  2. Loading messages cycle through at least 5 thematic strings while the DB initializes
  3. Navigating to the Encounters page does not crash or freeze — the page renders and is fully interactive
  4. The Radix ScrollArea component on the Encounters page renders without triggering an infinite re-render loop (no React "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in console)
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Animated d20 splash screen with TTRPG loading messages (SPLASH-01)
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — Replace Radix ScrollArea with native overflow div (FIX-01)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 12: Stat Block + Bestiary Data Quality
**Goal**: Creature ability descriptions are human-readable instead of raw Foundry markup, the stat block shows the complete 17-skill list, and the bestiary sources filter shows recognizable book names
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: STAT-01, STAT-02, BEST-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Ability descriptions in the stat block render @UUID, @Damage, @Check, @Template, and @Localize tokens as formatted human-readable text — no raw `@` markup is visible to the user
  2. The stat block skills section lists all 17 PF2e skills with their calculated modifiers — skills not present in Foundry data are derived from creature level + proficiency rank
  3. The bestiary sources filter dropdown shows human-readable book names (e.g., "Player Core", "Monster Core") rather than folder names (e.g., "pf2e", "sf2e")
  4. Selecting a book name in the sources filter correctly narrows the bestiary results to creatures from that source
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 13: Combat UX Sweep
**Goal**: The combat tracker is easier and faster to use — the DM can kill a dying creature in one click, the condition picker shows only combat-relevant conditions in a wider layout, and HP adjustments use a single input with clear action buttons
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: CMB-06, CMB-07, CMB-08, CMB-09, CMB-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The Dying recovery dialog includes a "Kill" button that immediately sets the combatant to dead without requiring a recovery roll
  2. The condition picker does not show Detection conditions (Observed, Hidden, Undetected, Unnoticed) or Attitude conditions (Hostile, Unfriendly, Friendly, Helpful, Indifferent)
  3. The condition picker is wide enough to show conditions in a multi-column grid — the DM can scan and select a condition without scrolling a narrow list
  4. HP controls show one numeric input field and three clearly labeled buttons (Damage / Heal / TempHP) — no separate input fields for each action
  5. The persistent damage modal opens correctly, displays the condition and damage amount, prompts for a flat-check, applies damage on failure, and removes the condition on success
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Condition picker: remove Detection/Attitudes, tabs + grid layout (CMB-07, CMB-08)
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — HP controls: single input + 3 action buttons with split-button damage (CMB-09)
- [x] 13-03-PLAN.md — Verify Kill button + Persistent Damage modal end-to-end (CMB-06, CMB-10)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 14: Stat Block Polish 2
**Goal**: Stat block is fully readable and visually polished — all Foundry token patterns resolved ([[/act]], [[/br]], {Nfeet} area templates), Fighter's Fork has correct weapon data (group=trident, shove trait, Brute Strength extra damage), and the color system makes key stats instantly scannable (section headers, HP, saves, damage types, trait tags, ability text)
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: STAT-01, STAT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. [[/act slug]] tokens render as action name (e.g. "Shove") — no raw [[ ]] markup visible
  2. [[/br expr #label]]{display} tokens render as display text only
  3. {Nfeet} area template tokens render as readable range text (e.g. "30-foot area")
  4. Fighter's Fork strike shows weapon group (trident), shove trait, and Brute Strength extra damage where applicable
  5. Section headers (Strikes, Abilities, Skills) have gradient/themed color treatment
  6. HP, saves, damage type labels, and trait tags each have distinct color coding for instant scanability
  7. Ability description text is visually distinct from ability names (bold names, readable body text)
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### 🚧 v0.5.0-pre-alpha — Combat Redesign + Spells

**Milestone Goal:** Redesign combat tracker into a 3-panel layout (Bestiary | Initiative+Detail | Stat Card), make Encounters the persistent source of truth for combat state, and add a complete spell system — import 1,797 spells from Foundry VTT, display spellcasting in stat blocks, add a spell catalog page, and track spell slot usage per encounter with non-destructive custom spell overrides.

- [ ] **Phase 15: Combat Tracker Layout Redesign** — New 3-panel layout with merged initiative+detail center, bestiary left, creature stat card right
- [x] **Phase 16: Encounter Persistence** — Encounters store creature lists; "Load into Combat" populates tracker; HP/conditions/slots save back to encounter SQLite (completed 2026-04-02)
- [x] **Phase 17: Spell Import Pipeline** — Parse 1,797 Foundry VTT spell files into SQLite; parse creature spellcasting entries and prepared spell lists (completed 2026-04-02)
- [x] **Phase 18: Spell Display + Catalog** — Spellcasting section in stat block (tradition, DC, attack, spells by rank); standalone Spells catalog page with FTS5 + filters (completed 2026-04-02)
- [x] **Phase 19: Spell Slot Tracking + Custom Override** — Per-encounter slot pip UI (click to toggle); slot state in encounter SQLite; custom spell add/remove per encounter (non-destructive) (completed 2026-04-02)

### Phase 15: Combat Tracker Layout Redesign
**Goal**: The combat tracker renders as 3 panels — Bestiary search (left), merged initiative list + creature detail (center), creature stat card (right) — and selecting a combatant in the initiative list updates both the center detail view and the right stat card simultaneously
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Requirements**: CMBL-01, CMBL-02, CMBL-03, CMBL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The combat tracker page renders 3 resizable panels: bestiary search left, merged initiative+detail center, stat card right — with no separate "detail panel" modal or tab switch needed
  2. The center panel shows the initiative order list at the top and the selected creature's HP controls, conditions, and turn buttons below it — both visible at once without scrolling off-screen
  3. Clicking any row in the initiative list selects that combatant and immediately updates the right panel to show that creature's full stat block (same stat block as Bestiary)
  4. The bestiary search left panel is functional — DM can search creatures and add them to the initiative list from the same panel without a modal
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Restructure CombatPage into 3-panel layout: Bestiary left, Initiative+Detail center (nested vertical), Stat Card right; lazy NPC stat block fetch with sticky panel + in-memory cache (CMBL-01, CMBL-02, CMBL-03, CMBL-04)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 16: Encounter Persistence
**Goal**: Encounters become the source of truth for combat state — each saved encounter stores its creature list, and the combat tracker loads from an encounter rather than managing creatures independently; combat HP/condition changes write back to encounter SQLite
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: ENCP-01, ENCP-02, ENCP-03, ENCP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Creating an encounter in the Encounters page allows adding creatures to a persistent creature list — the list survives app restart
  2. Clicking "Load into Combat" on a saved encounter navigates to the combat tracker pre-populated with that encounter's creature list, correct HP, and weak/elite tiers
  3. Dealing damage to a combatant in the tracker writes the updated HP to the encounter's SQLite record in real time — reopening the encounter shows the updated HP
  4. Clicking "Reset Encounter" restores all combatants to their initial HP, clears all conditions, and marks all spell slots as available
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 16-01-PLAN.md — DB migration (encounters/encounter_combatants/encounter_conditions tables) + shared/api/encounters.ts + Encounter entity type expansion (ENCP-01..04 foundation)
- [ ] 16-02-PLAN.md — EncountersPage split layout: SavedEncounterList + EncounterEditor + EncounterCreatureSearchPanel with [W][+][E] add (ENCP-01)
- [ ] 16-03-PLAN.md — Load into Combat + encounter write-back auto-save + Reset Encounter (ENCP-02, ENCP-03, ENCP-04)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 17: Spell Import Pipeline
**Goal**: All 1,797 Foundry VTT spells are stored in SQLite and accessible by the frontend; spellcasting entries and prepared spell lists for NPC creatures are parsed and linked to creature records
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: SPLI-01, SPLI-02, SPLI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After running sync, the `spells` table contains 1,700+ rows with foundry_id, name, rank, traditions, traits, description, damage, area, range, duration, action_cost, save_stat, and source_book populated
  2. Spellcaster NPC creatures (e.g. Death Tower Necromancer) have their spellcasting entries stored — tradition "arcane", cast_type "prepared", DC 29, attack +21, slots for ranks 0–5
  3. The prepared spell list for the Death Tower Necromancer can be queried from SQLite and returns the correct spells for each rank as shown in the Foundry JSON
**Plans**: 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md — DB migration: spells + creature_spellcasting_entries + creature_spell_lists tables with FTS5 (SPLI-01..03 foundation)
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md — Spell extraction from entity raw_json + creature spellcasting parse + shared/api/spells.ts query functions (SPLI-01, SPLI-02, SPLI-03)

### Phase 18: Spell Display + Catalog
**Goal**: Spellcaster creatures show their spellcasting section in the stat block with expandable spell cards, and a new Spells page lets the DM browse and search all 1,797 imported spells
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: SPLD-01, SPLD-02, SPLD-03, SPLC-01, SPLC-02, SPLC-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Opening the Death Tower Necromancer's stat block shows a "Spellcasting" section with "Arcane Prepared" badge, DC 29, attack +21, and spells grouped by rank (Cantrips through Rank 5)
  2. Clicking a spell name in the stat block expands it inline showing area, range, duration, damage formula, save type, traits, and heightening rules
  3. The Spells page loads with all imported spells listed; typing a spell name in the search box filters results via FTS5 in under 200ms
  4. Filtering by tradition "arcane" and rank "5" shows only arcane rank-5 spells
**Plans**: 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md — SpellcastingSection type + fetchCreatureStatBlockData async loader (SPLD-01..03 foundation)
- [x] 18-02-PLAN.md — SpellcastingBlock + SpellCard in CreatureStatBlock; full SpellsPage with FTS5 search + tradition/rank filters (SPLD-01, SPLD-02, SPLD-03, SPLC-01, SPLC-02, SPLC-03)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 19: Spell Slot Tracking + Custom Override
**Goal**: The DM can track which spell slots have been used for each spellcasting creature in an encounter, and can non-destructively customize a creature's prepared spell list for a specific encounter
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: SLOT-01, SLOT-02, SLOT-03, CUST-01, CUST-02, CUST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The creature stat card in the combat tracker shows spell slots for each rank as clickable pips (e.g. ●●○○ for 2 used out of 4); clicking a pip toggles it used/available
  2. After marking slots used and switching away from the combat tab, returning shows the same slot state — stored in encounter SQLite, not lost on navigation
  3. From the Encounters page, the DM can open a creature's spell override editor, search for a spell by name, and add it to a rank — the encounter's combat load reflects the addition without modifying the base creature
  4. Removing a spell from a prepared list in the override editor removes it from that encounter's display only — the creature's base spells in the `creatures` table are unchanged
**Plans**: 2/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [x] 19-01-PLAN.md — DB migration: encounter_spell_slots + encounter_combatant_spells; API functions in encounters.ts (SLOT-01..03, CUST-01..03 foundation)
- [x] 19-02-PLAN.md — SlotPips + AddSpellRow + SpellcastingBlock extended with encounterContext; CombatPage wired (SLOT-01, SLOT-02, SLOT-03, CUST-01, CUST-02, CUST-03)
**UI hint**: yes

## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Stat block card in combat tracker (FULFILLED)

**Goal:** Integrate the bestiary stat block card into the combat tracker — clicking a combatant in the tracker opens the same full stat block (with MAP, IWR, abilities, etc.) that's shown in the bestiary browser
**Status:** Fulfilled in Phase 15 (3-panel layout with stat card right panel)
**Plans:** Delivered as part of Phase 15-01-PLAN.md
