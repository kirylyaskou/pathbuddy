**Milestone:** Day-One Patch (PathMaid rebrand + polish + fixes)

---

## v1 Requirements

### Rebrand (BRAND)

- [x] **BRAND-01**: App is renamed Pathbuddy → PathMaid across all configs (tauri.conf.json, package.json, DB filename, app identifier) and all UI strings — Phase 47

### Data Quality (SANITIZE)

- [x] **SANITIZE-01**: All unresolved Foundry @-tokens in entity descriptions are removed — no raw tokens visible in any UI surface — Phase 48

### Encounters UX (ENC)

- [x] **ENC-01**: Encounter creation uses explicit "New Encounter" button, not ambiguous "+" — Phase 49
- [x] **ENC-02**: Creature search in encounters supports extended filters: family, traits, source — Phase 49
- [x] **ENC-03**: Creature lists in encounter builder are sorted by level — Phase 49

### Mascot (MASCOT)

- [x] **MASCOT-01**: Goblin maid GIF animation plays on SplashScreen (replaces D20Die), Foundry sync overlay, and Dashboard EncountersCard empty state — with CSS sway animation — Phase 50

### XP Engine (XP)

- [x] **XP-01**: XP budget and group level calculator are audited and produce correct values per PF2e CRB rules for all encounter threat levels — Phase 51

### Bug Fixes (BUG)

- [x] **BUG-01**: 0-initiative bug on encounter load after app restart is fixed — encounters load with correct initiative values — Phase 52
- [x] **DICE-01**: Dice roll toasts stack vertically in a column and auto-dismiss after timeout — no overlapping toasts — Phase 52

### Code Quality (AUDIT)

- [x] **AUDIT-01**: Full code audit complete — dead code removed, React performance issues addressed, FSD violations fixed, TypeScript strictness improved — Phase 53

### Platform Builds (CICD)

- [x] **CICD-01**: Linux and Android CI/CD builds work via GitHub Actions — Phase 54

## Future Requirements

### v1.2 (deferred)

- Mascot in CombatPage empty state (openTabs.length === 0)
- Mascot in InitiativeList empty state (combatants.length === 0)
- Additional mascot variants per page
- Hazard stat block in right panel when hazard selected in combat
- Level range filter in BestiarySearchPanel
